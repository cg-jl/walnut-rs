# walnut-rs

A Rust port of [TheCherno](https://github.com/TheCherno)'s [Walnut](https://github.com/TheCherno/Walnut/tree/5afd5d6ba537f460898f870cfcfbc77633778ce0) 
GUI library.

Most of the work has been leveraged to [this awesome library](https://github.com/adrien-ben/imgui-rs-vulkan-renderer) that already implements all of the features needed.
